# Data Analysis with Python Projects from freeCodeCamp

There are five projects that must be completed in order to obtain the Data Analysis with Python Certification from freeCodeCamp. This repository contains every piece of Python code I've written.

1. Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator

In this project, I created the `calculate()` function in `mean_var_std.py`, which uses Numpy to produce the mean, variance, standard deviation, maximum, minimum, and sum of the rows, columns, and elements in a 3 x 3 matrix. You can read more about it [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/mean-variance-standard-deviation-calculator) or run the code directly from [my replit](https://replit.com/@SriHartini4/mean-variance-standard-deviation-calculator-by-bluesky?v=1).

2. Demographic Data Analyzer

Given a dataset of demographic data that was collected from the 1994 Census database, I used Pandas to analyze the demographic data for this task. You can read more about it [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/demographic-data-analyzer) or run the code directly from [my replit](https://replit.com/@SriHartini4/demographic-data-analyzer-by-sri?v=1).

3. Medical Data Visualizer

In this project, I used matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas to visualize and calculate data from medical examination data. You can read more about it [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/medical-data-visualizer) or run the code directly from [my replit](https://replit.com/@SriHartini4/medical-data-visualizer-by-sri?v=1).

4. Page View Time Series Visualizer

In this assignment, I used line charts, bar charts, and box plots to depict time series data. I visualized a dataset including the daily page views on the freeCodeCamp.org forum from 2016-05-09 to 2019-12-03 using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Thanks to data visualizations, I can better comprehend visitation trends and spot yearly and monthly growth. You can read more about it [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/page-view-time-series-visualizer) or run the code directly from [my replit](https://replit.com/@SriHartini4/page-view-time-series-visualizer-by-sri?v=1).

5. Sea Level Predictor

In this project, I examined data on the global average sea level change since 1880 and utilized the analysis to forecast sea level rise through the year 2050. You can read more about it [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/sea-level-predictor) or run the code directly from [my replit](https://replit.com/@SriHartini4/sea-level-predictor-by-sri?v=1).
